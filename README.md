- 👋 Greetings, I’m 0b1_w4n_K3n0b1, Guardian of the Arcane!
- 👀 I’m interested in mastering ancient cyber-mysteries and defending the Graal Virtuel.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the secrets of data encryption and decoding arcane algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quests that defy the corporations and uphold the knowledge of the ancients.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send a holo-message through the Arcane network (or the comment section, but that's less mystical).
- 😄 Pronouns: Code-Warrior/Protocol-Protector
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve been around since the first datapulse, and yes, I trained *many* young firebrands.

> ✨ “The code is strong with this one.” ✨
